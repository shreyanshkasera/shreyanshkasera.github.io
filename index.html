  <h1>🚀 Chronicles of a 13-Year-Old Visionary: The Ascent Begins</h1>
  <p>Hi there! 👋</p>
  <p>
    You are about to witness a fantastic journey — full of ups & downs, failures & victories — told by a 13-year-old learner, innovator, explorer, and builder. 💡
  </p>
  <p>
    This is not just a blog. It’s an evolving story that might feel like you’re listening to a mentor, a friend, a brother, or even a guide.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>THE JOURNEY BEGINS — in Shreyansh Kasera’s own words.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Here, I’ll share what I learn, create, and explore in the world of AI, science, maths, innovation, and entrepreneurship. 📚🤖⚙️
  </p>
  <p>
    I truly believe that even young minds can solve real-world problems. Age doesn’t limit imagination or impact.
  </p>
  <p>
    My dream? 🌟 To reach Stanford, and to build meaningful projects that the world remembers.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ll be posting new content on the <strong>10th, 20th, and 30th</strong> of every month — so stay tuned!
  </p>
